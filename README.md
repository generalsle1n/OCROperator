## Installation for Production Usage

Publish the project with the following settings
- Config:               ```Release```

```
    
## Roadmap

- Add an Microsoft Busines Central Action
- Add more watchers (Database, Mailbox, eg.)

## Lessons Learned

Used mostly Interfaces to allowes multiple classes that can define actions over an user controlled config file
## Feedback

If you have any feedback, please open an issue or an pull request ðŸ˜€


## Features
This tool searchs asynchron for pdf and metadata that are specifid in an watcher config.
If the tool finds some the tools process the pdf with the ocr enginge tesseract to get the text and then the file with the text is transferd to an action which can do any stuff with the pdf (Upload to an ticketsystem, erp, crm or so on)
Currently it only works in connection with papercut mf, because papercut generate an metadata json which is processed

### Watchers
Currently there is only one Watcher implemented:

#### FileSystem
This watchers looks in an folder for the pdf

### Actions

#### FileToZammad
This action trys to extract an ticketnumber and then upload the pdf to this ticket.
If no ticket is found then it create an empty ticket

The setting is splitted by an ;
- Zammad URL
- API Token
- UserID (In the example the 1)

So the string must look like: https://zammadserver.com;SECRET;1


#### FileToUser

This actions send the extracted text to the user mail that is specifid in the metadata json from papercut.
The mail settings are specifid via the mailfactory solution
## FAQ

#### Can i add by my own an custom action?

Yeah sure --> If you think its good and create an pull request to merge it

#### Will there be an implementation without papercut?

Currently its not planned, but if you want to implement it just open an pull request too
